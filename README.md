The credit card fraud detection system in the provided repository consists of the following key functions and system design components:

1. **Fraud Detection Function (`is_fraudulent(transaction)`)**: This function checks various criteria to determine if a transaction is fraudulent. It includes checks for high transaction amounts, transactions in suspicious categories, transactions from rare device types, and frequent transactions in a short time.

2. **Main Function (`main()`)**: The main function orchestrates the credit card transaction processing flow. It creates a Kafka topic for credit card transactions, sends transactions to Kafka, sets up ksqlDB for real-time analytics, and inserts flagged transactions into MongoDB.

3. **MongoDB Connection Setup and Transaction Insertion**: The system connects to MongoDB using the provided URI, inserts flagged transactions into the MongoDB collection, and closes the connection after the operation is completed.

4. **Real-time Analytics with Flink SQL**: The system uses Apache Flink for real-time analytics. It initializes `StreamExecutionEnvironment` and `StreamTableEnvironment`, creates a table for flagged transactions, and executes SQL queries to perform analytics like counting transactions, calculating average amount, etc., in real-time.

5. **Kafka Producer and Consumer**: Kafka is used for streaming transactions. The system includes a Kafka producer to publish credit card transactions and a consumer to read these transactions for processing.

6. **Kafka Streams Processing with ksqlDB**: The system leverages ksqlDB for stream processing. It uses ksqlDB to create streams, functions, and processes flagged transactions based on specific criteria like high amounts, suspicious categories, and device types.

7. **Kafka Integration**: The system integrates Kafka for transaction processing and messaging between different components of the fraud detection system.

8. **HTTP Requests for ksqlDB Commands Execution**: The system executes SQL commands on the ksqlDB server using HTTP requests with appropriate headers.

In summary, the credit card fraud detection system within the repository combines elements like fraud detection logic, real-time analytics with Flink SQL, MongoDB storage for flagged transactions, Kafka for streaming, and ksqlDB for processing and flagging fraudulent transactions in a real-time streaming pipeline.
